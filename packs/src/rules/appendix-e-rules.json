By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"gaining-inspiration\">Gaining Inspiration</h2><p>Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.</p><p>You either have inspiration or you don't—you can't stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"using-inspiration\">Using Inspiration</h2><p>If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.</p><p>Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.</p>",

They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p><p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.

A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p><p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal.

Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p><p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.TjWk2mpNXjDdfIDM]{Carpet of Flying}, allow you to travel more swiftly.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption>Travel Pace</caption><thead><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Pace</td><td colspan=\"4\">Distance Traveled per . . .</td></tr><tr><td>Minute</td><td>Hour</td><td>Day</td><td>Effect</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fast</td><td>400 feet</td><td>4 miles</td><td>30 miles</td><td>- 5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td></tr><tr><td>Normal</td><td>300 feet</td><td>3 miles</td><td>24 miles</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Slow</td><td>200 feet</td><td>2 miles</td><td>18 miles</td><td>Able to use stealth</td></tr></tbody></table>",

If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p><p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p><p>A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>",
